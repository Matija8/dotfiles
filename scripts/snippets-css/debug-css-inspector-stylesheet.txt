First way, inspector-stylesheet:

Open Inspect Element (F12 Or Ctrl+ Shift+I)

Go to Elements tab (Ctrl+ Shift+ P and type show elements),
if you are not already there, see the Styles tab, now see on right corner,
there would be a + icon, click it
(or long press that icon if it doesn't automatically add inspector-stylesheet),
it will add selector of currently highlighted element, just next to the selector,
there will a link/button inspector-stylesheet, click it,
it will take you a window, where you can add styles.

Watch for the "+" icon!
