Exported variables get passed on to child processes, not-exported variables do not.
    export PATH=$PATH:"$HOME/_Matija-Scripts/bin"

Export doesn't need an inline setting:
    ZTESTMATIJA="test1"
    export ZTESTMATIJA

To debug env vars, run:
    printenv
or:
    env -0 | sort -z | tr '\0' '\n'
or if dotfiles are copied:
    printenvSorted
    penv

In bash environment variables can also be passed inline with the command.
    ZZZ_MATIJA_TEST_ZZZ="test works" env -0 | sort -z | tr '\0' '\n'
or:
    ZZZ_MATIJA_TEST_ZZZ="test works" printenvSorted

Windows environment variables can be set with `set X=...`?!

In npm package.json scripts you can use the `cross-env` package to set env vars
This way Unix* and Windows machines can run the same scripts.
    "gh-next-export": "cross-env DEPLOY_ENV=github-pages-env npm run export",
