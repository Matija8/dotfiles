- The rules are in the React-Template repo
- Put the .eslintrc into the same folder the `package.json` is.
  - Otherwise eslint will fail to find plugins
- Don't set project field in parser options, it messes with vscode.
- Don't install eslint for a create-react-app - it's already installed.
- always try `npm run lint` for sanity checking. It might just be a vscode problem.
- Add 'lint' rule to package.json
  - "lint": "eslint ."
