Workspaces symlink your projects to node_modules!
Prepend @w/ to your workspace to not pull from npm registry!

You will have node_modules only in your root dir!

Workspace debugging commands:
yarn workspaces info --json
yarn workspaces list --json # ?? Works on versions > 1?

Export shared typescript workspaces as if they were a published npm library.
That means build .ts files to dist as .js + .d.ts files!?

You need a tsconfig.json in your /shared workspace.
